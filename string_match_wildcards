#---Problem Statement---
# Difficulty :Hard

#Given two strings where first string may contain wild card characters and second string is a normal string. Write a function that returns true if the two strings match. The following are allowed wild card characters in first string. 

# * --> Matches with 0 or more instances of any character or set of characters.
# ? --> Matches with any one character.
# For example, “g*ks” matches with “geeks” match. And string “ge?ks*” matches with “geeksforgeeks” (note ‘*’ at the end of first string). But “g*k” doesn’t match with “gee” as character ‘k’ is not present in second string.



def solve(a,b):
    n,m=len(a),len(b)
    if n==0 and m==0:
        return True
    if n > 1 and a[0] == ‘*’ and m == 0:
        return False
    if (n > 1 and a[0] == ‘?’) or (n != 0 and m !=0 and a[0] == b[0]):
        return solve(a[1:],b[1:]);
    if n !=0 and a[0] == ‘*’:
        return solve(a[1:],b) or solve(a,b[1:])
    return False

str1=input(“Enter string containing wild characters:\n“)
str2=input(“Enter string to be matched:\n“)
print(solve(str1,str2))
